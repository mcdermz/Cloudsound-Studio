# Cloudsound Studio

A real-time, collaborative music making experience in the cloud. Users work together to interact with audio files via the Web Audio API to make their own mixes using a virtual studio.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this repo, run `yarn install` to install the dependencies, then run `npm start` to spin up the server and allow you to use the app on a `localhost` port. To run a development server, run `npm run dev` and any changes you make to the server or client files will be automatically updated.

### Prerequisites

Cloudsound Studio currently streams the audio files from an Amazon S3 bucket.  To change the source of streaming audio you will need to edit the `baseUrl` within `public/app/studio/studio-service.js`. Also note that the current string manipulation code depends on the S3 bucket having a `:baseUrl/:category/:filename` format. For example: `s3-bucket-name/drums/bonham-drum-beat.mp3`.

## Deployment

This app is currently deployed on Heroku. To deploy, run:
```
$ git commit -m 'prep for deployment'
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
```
